## 🧠 The Problem
We all struggle with self-discipline. Whether it's scrolling **TikTok**, checking **Instagram**, or unlocking a game when we should be working, the urge for "instant dopamine" is hard to fight.

Many of us use **App Blockers** (like *Cold Turkey*, * Lock me out*) to lock these distractions away. But there is a fatal flaw:

*   **If you keep the password**, you will eventually cave in and unlock the app during a moment of weakness.
*   **If you give the password to a friend**, they might not be awake or available when you genuinely need emergency access.

## 🛡️ The Solution: "Friction as a Service"
**The Attrition Vault** acts as that strict friend who is always available but refuses to make it easy for you.

It allows you to store your App Blocker passwords (or any text) inside a secure, encrypted vault. To get the password back, you don't need a key—**you need to pay with time and effort.**

The Vault forces you to manually type a **2,000+ character passage** of boring literature (like legal texts or old novels).

> 🚫 **No Copy/Paste allowed.**
>
> ❌ **One typo stops your progress.**
>
> ⏳ **Takes 15-20 minutes of focus.**

It creates just enough **friction** to stop impulsive scrolling, but keeps the password accessible if you genuinely have an emergency need for it.

## ✨ Key Features
*   **Privacy First & Serverless:** The app is stateless. Your password is encrypted and stored inside the **URL itself** (using LZ-String). No database, no tracking, no data leaks.
*   **The "Typist" Challenge:** A gamified, dark-mode interface that forces you to transcribe long texts perfectly.
*   **Anti-Cheat Mechanisms:** Disables pasting and validates input character-by-character.
*   **30-Second Self-Destruct:** Once you earn the password, it is visible for only **30 seconds** before fading away.
*   **Forever Hosting:** Since it relies on URL-based encryption, as long as you have the link, your data is safe. It creates a permanent "Magic Link" you can email to yourself.

## 🚀 How to Use It
1.  **Generate a Random Password:** Use a tool to create a complex password (e.g., `Xy9#mP2!`).
2.  **Lock Your Distraction:** Use that password to lock your App Blocker (**Cold Turkey**, **Lock Me Out**, etc.).
3.  **Seal the Vault:** Enter that password into **The Attrition Vault**.
4.  **Save the Key:** The site generates a long **Recovery URL**. Email this link to yourself  with a subject like *"TikTok Unlock Key"*.
5.  **Delete:** Delete the password from your clipboard and notes.
5.  **Open the Recovery URL:** To access the Password in case of Emergency open the Recovery URL you just saved. Now, you are free. If you want to unlock TikTok, click the link, and **suffer through 20 minutes of typing.**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Vanilla HTML/JS:** Lightweight, fast, and no dependencies.
